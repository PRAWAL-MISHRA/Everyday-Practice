# Everyday-Practice
I have been practicing since 4 years but from 28th June,2019 I have decided to show what I practice to you all.
This repository contains the JAVA Programs which I daily practice so that my skills don't go stale with time...
The program with least lines of code is with 65 lines of code.
The no.of lines of code in a Program will keep increasing every other day with time.
